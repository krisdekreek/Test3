## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
head(cars)
```

```
##   speed dist
## 1     4    2
## 2     4   10
## 3     7    4
## 4     7   22
## 5     8   16
## 6     9   10
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](Test3_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```r
234 - 34*23
```

```
## [1] -548
```
